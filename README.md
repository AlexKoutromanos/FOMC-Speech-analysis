# FinBERT Sentiment Analysis

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using the FinBERT model. The FinBERT model is a pre-trained NLP model based on BERT, fine-tuned specifically for financial sentiment analysis. The notebook allows users to input text data (e.g., financial news or earnings reports) and classify each input into three categories: Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiment.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need:

- Google Colab account or local Jupyter environment
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages: `transformers`, `pandas`, `torch`

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, use the following commands in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install torch
pip install pandas
```

Alternatively, in a Google Colab environment, you can use the following cells within the notebook to install the dependencies:

```python
!pip install transformers
!pip install torch
!pip install pandas
```

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the FinBERT model and dependencies.
3. Input your financial text or dataset for sentiment classification.
4. Review the output for classified sentiment.

### Running the Sentiment Analysis:

1. Upload your financial text dataset or input individual text for analysis.
2. The notebook will classify each input as Positive, Neutral, or Negative, based on the FinBERT model.

## Notebook Overview

### Key Sections:

- **Setup**: Install necessary libraries like `transformers`, `torch`, and load FinBERT.
- **Model Initialization**: Loads FinBERT from the Hugging Face `transformers` library.
- **Sentiment Classification**: The core of the notebookâ€”this section processes input text, tokenizes it, and uses FinBERT to predict the sentiment.
- **Visualization**: Displays results, either through textual output or visualizations like bar graphs to show the sentiment distribution.

### Example Input:

```python
texts = [
    "The company reported a substantial increase in revenue.",
    "There are concerns about the recent market downturn.",
    "The board is uncertain about the company's future."
]
```

### Example Output:

The notebook will output sentiment predictions for each input:

```
Positive
Negative
Neutral
```
